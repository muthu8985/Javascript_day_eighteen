      Modules-JavaScript modules allow you to break up your code into separate
      files.

      JSON is a format for storing and transporting data. JSON is often used
      when data is sent from a server to a web page.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is JSON? JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation JSON is a
      lightweight data interchange format JSON is language independent * JSON is
      "self-describing" and easy to understand
    </p>
    <p id="json">
      let text = '{ "employees" : [' + '{ "firstName":"John" , "lastName":"Doe"
      },' + '{ "firstName":"Anna" , "lastName":"Smith" },' + '{
      "firstName":"Peter" , "lastName":"Jones" } ]}';
    </p>
    <script>
      let text =
        '{"employees":[' +
        '{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe" },' +
        '{"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Smith" },' +
        '{"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Jones" }]}';

      const obj = JSON.parse(text);
      document.getElementById("json").innerHTML =
        obj.employees[1].firstName + " " + obj.employees[1].lastName;
    </script>

      Code Debugging Programming code might contain syntax errors, or logical
      errors. Many of these errors are difficult to diagnose. JavaScript
      Debuggers Debugging is not easy. But fortunately, all modern browsers have
      a built-in JavaScript debugger. Built-in debuggers can be turned on and
      off, forcing errors to be reported to the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      Activate debugging in your browser (Chrome, IE, Firefox) with F12, and
      select "Console" in the debugger menu.
    </p>

    <script>
      a = 5;
      b = 6;
      c = a + b;
      console.log(c);
    </script>
    <p>
      Variable Names At W3schools we use camelCase for identifier names
      (variables and functions). All names start with a letter. Spaces Around
      Operators Always put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ), and after
      commas: Code Indentation Always use 2 spaces for indentation of code
      blocks: Statement Rules General rules for simple statements: Always end a
      simple statement with a semicolon.
    </p>

      Best practices Avoid Using eval() The eval() function is used to run text
      as code. In almost all cases, it should not be necessary to use it.
      Because it allows arbitrary code to be run, it also represents a security
      problem.
    </p>
    <p>Reduce DOM Access</p>
    <script>
      const objs = document.getElementById("demo");
      objs.innerHTML = "Hello";
    </script>
    <p>
      Avoid Using with Avoid using the with keyword. It has a negative effect on
      speed. It also clutters up JavaScript scopes. The with keyword is not
      allowed in strict mode.
